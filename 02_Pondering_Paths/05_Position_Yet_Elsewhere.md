```
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /tmp directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
