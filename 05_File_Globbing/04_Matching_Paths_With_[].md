# Challenge 4 : Matching With []

Developed an understanding of matching paths with []

## My solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{Ywe_W6m5Np8f1A4UhRlLg-nqXM6.QX0IDO0wiN3gjNzEzW}

What I Learnt: Understood how to use the [] to bracket glob into absolute paths

- As the challenge asked I ran /challenge/run and gave the argument as /challenge/files/file[bash] to bracket glob into the absolute paths for the required files to get the flag

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Ywe_W6m5Np8f1A4UhRlLg-nqXM6.QX0IDO0wiN3gjNzEzW}
```
