# Challenge 6 : Storing Command Output

Developed an understanding of how to store the output of a command into a variable

## My solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{cftJLL3tjbv4c60xLByUoiZYJFb.QX1cDN1wiN3gjNzEzW}

What I Learnt: How to store the output of a command inside a variable

- As told in the challenge I just assigned the output of the command into PWN and then just printed it

```
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ PWN=$(/challenge/run)
Congratulations! You have read the flag into the PWN variable. Now print it out
and submit it!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ echo $PWN
pwn.college{cftJLL3tjbv4c60xLByUoiZYJFb.QX1cDN1wiN3gjNzEzW}
```
