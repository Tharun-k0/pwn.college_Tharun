# Challenge 4 : Grepping For A Needle In A Haystack

Developed an understanding of the grep command

## My solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{EQTWYdNKz8-jU1gHI9cnYG604cq.QX3EDO0wiN3gjNzEzW}

What I Learnt: Understood the working of the grep command

- Searched for the flag by taking the argument string as pwn.college since every flag starts with that and put in the location as given by the question

```
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{EQTWYdNKz8-jU1gHI9cnYG604cq.QX3EDO0wiN3gjNzEzW}
```
